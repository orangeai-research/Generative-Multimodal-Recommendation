# Loss weights for GUME
bm_loss: 0.01               # Behavior-modality alignment loss weight
um_loss: 0.01               # User modality enhancement loss weight
vt_loss: 0.1                # Vision-text alignment loss weight

# Temperature parameters
bm_temp: 0.4                # Temperature for behavior-modality InfoNCE

# ===== Rectified Flow Parameters =====
use_rf: True                # Enable RF for extended_id_embeds generation (set False for ablation)

# RF Network Architecture
rf_hidden_dim: 256          # Hidden dimension of velocity field network
rf_n_layers: 3              # Number of layers in velocity field network
rf_dropout: 0.1             # Dropout rate for RF network

# RF Training & Sampling
rf_sampling_steps: 10       # ODE solver steps (balance between speed and quality)
                            # - 1 step: fastest but lower quality
                            # - 10 steps: good balance (recommended)
                            # - 100 steps: highest quality but slower

# RF Loss Weights
rf_loss_weight: 1.0         # Weight for RF velocity field loss
contrast_loss_weight: 0.1   # Weight for InfoNCE contrast loss between generated and target embeds
